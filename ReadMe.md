# E-Cafeteria
## Project Name: E-Cafeteria
#### Authors: Arnold Ndiwalana, Paul Owori and Lukwiya Sunday.



### Description:

#### This project is a web-based platform that connects customers who want food to service providers who provide them within the customer's locality. Customers can create accounts and log onto the website so that they can view menu and make orders for the food they want, and the food can then be delivered. Service providers can create accounts and log onto the website so that they can be able to upload their food menu and wait for customers' orders. The service providers will be able to deliver the food to the customers based on the location information provided by the customers while creating their account. Payment for the food ordered can be in cash or through mobile money platforms. Customers will be able to rate both the service providers and the food they receive. Based on this information, service providers can be able to identify customers' preferences and also improve on some of their services so as to meet customers' demand for quality services.
